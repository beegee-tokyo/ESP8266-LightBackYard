This project uses an ESP8266 for an WiFi controlled relay. In this application it is used to switch on lights in my back yard.    
Parts used:    
 - ESP8266    
 - Relay for light    
The back yard light control is part of my home control system.    
The lights can be switched on by another device in my home control system or manually from a PC or Android tablet
